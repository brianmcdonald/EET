# Backend Environment Variables
# Currently the backend doesn't require environment variables,
# but this file is here for future configuration needs.

# Example: Database URL (when/if database is added)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/eet

# Example: CORS origins (if you want to restrict CORS in production)
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
